In Clojurescript only\n                        `:p2d` and `:p3d` renderers are supported.\n                        More info on Clojure renderers:\n                        https://processing.org/reference/environment/#Renderers\n  * `:output-file`    - Specifies an output file path. Only used in `:pdf` and\n                        `:svg` modes. Not supported in Clojurescript. When\n                        writing to a file, call [[exit]] at the end of the\n                        `draw` call to end the sketch and not write repeatedly\n                        to the file.\n  * `:title`          - A string which will be displayed at the top of\n                        the sketch window. Not supported in Clojurescript.\n  * `:features`       - A vector of keywords customizing sketch behaviour.\n                        Supported features:\n    - `:keep-on-top`   - Sketch window will always be above other windows.\n                         Note: some platforms might not support always-on-top\n                         windows. Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:exit-on-close` - Shutdown JVM  when sketch is closed.\n                         Not supported in Clojurescript.\n    - `:resizable`     - Makes sketch resizable. Not supported in Clojurescript.\n    - `:no-safe-fns`   - Do not catch and print exceptions thrown inside\n                         functions provided to sketch (like draw,\n                         [[mouse-pressed?]], [[key-pressed?]] and others). By\n                         default all exceptions thrown inside these functions\n                         are caught. This prevents the sketch from breaking when\n                         a bad function is provided and allows you to fix it and\n                         reload it on the fly. You can disable this behaviour by\n                         enabling the `:no-safe-fns` feature. Not supported in\n                         Clojurescript.\n    - `:present`       - Switch to present mode (fullscreen without borders, OS\n                         panels). You may want to use this feature together with\n                         `:size :fullscreen`. Not supported in ClojureScript. In\n                         ClojureScript fullscreen is enabled by pressing F11 and\n                         it's enabled on all sketches automatically.\n    - `:no-start`      - Disables autostart if sketch was created using the\n                         [[defsketch]] macro. To start sketch you have to call\n                         function created [[defsketch]]. Supported only in\n                         ClojureScript.\n                        Usage example: `:features [:keep-on-top :present]`\n  * `:bgcolor`        - Sets background color for unused space in present mode.\n                        Color is specified in hex format for example\n                        `:bgcolor \"#00FFFF\"` (cyan background)\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:display`        - Sets what display should be used by this sketch.\n                        Displays are numbered starting from 0.\n                        Example: `:display 1`.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:setup`          - A function to be called once when setting the sketch up.\n  * `:draw`           - A function to be repeatedly called at most n times per\n                        second where n is the target [[frame-rate]] set for\n                        the visualisation.\n  * `:host`           - String id of canvas element or DOM element itself.\n                        Specifies host for the sketch. Must be specified in\n                        sketch, may be omitted in defsketch. If omitted in\n                        [[defsketch]], `:host` is set to the name of the sketch.\n                        If element with specified id is not found on the page\n                        and page is empty, a new canvas element will be created.\n                        Used in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-gained`   - Called when the sketch gains focus.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-lost`     - Called when the sketch loses focus.

A function to be called once when\n                        setting sketch up. Should be used only for [[smooth]]\n                        and [[no-smooth]].
